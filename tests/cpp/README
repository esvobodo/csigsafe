Tests in this directory are supposed to discover what features of c++ language 
csigsafe isn't able to check properly.

Problems discovered:
    - csigsafe couldn't distinguish c++ library and user-defined functions properly (fixed)
    - namespaces and function overloads cause wrong functions to be controled because csigsafe
        checks them only on basis of their name
    - properly checks only code inside one file 
        (code divided in multiple files won't be checked properly)

Exploanatory notes - file name starting with:
    *_name ... discovered bugs
    _name .... ok (no bug found)
